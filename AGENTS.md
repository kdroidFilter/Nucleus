# AGENTS.md

## Goal
- Help develop Nucleus with targeted, safe changes.

## Principles
- Prefer minimal changes that are easy to review.
- Follow the existing Kotlin style and project architecture.
- Verify that the project compiles and that the linter passes after significant changes.
- Do not change global configuration (CI, release, major dependencies) without an explicit request.
