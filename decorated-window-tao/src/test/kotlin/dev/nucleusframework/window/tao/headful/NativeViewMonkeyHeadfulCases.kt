/**
 * Compose and an embedded native widget under one pointer, hit faster than a
 * human can and in every order a random walk finds.
 *
 * The failures this is after are the ones a user reports as "it went dead":
 * after a few quick clicks between a Compose control and a native view, the
 * Compose side stops taking clicks, the I-beam never comes back over the text
 * field, or keystrokes go to whichever side had focus last but the caret
 * shows on the other. None of those is a crash; each is a state two input
 * routers — Compose's hit-testing and the platform's own (GtkEventBox capture,
 * AppKit's responder chain, Win32 focus) — disagree about, reached through an
 * interleaving nobody wrote a case for.
 *
 * The fixture is the smallest desktop that has both routers: a `BasicTextField`
 * (I-beam, Compose focus), a Compose button, a [NativeView] embedding a real
 * text widget ([NativeProbe]: it *takes* native focus and *shows* an I-beam of
 * its own), and a Compose button drawn *over* the native view through the
 * `content` slot — the blending path.
 *
 * What is asserted is not "the right thing happened" but that both routers
 * still agree and still answer, re-checked after every burst:
 *
 *  - **responsiveness** — a click on either Compose button is counted, a
 *    click on the field focuses it;
 *  - **one keyboard owner** — Compose focus and native focus are never both
 *    held, and a typed letter lands on exactly the side that holds it;
 *  - **the cursor** — a still pointer over the field leaves `TEXT` as the
 *    last requested cursor and keeps it (no flicker from a stray move);
 *  - **no leak, no wedge** — every probe an unmount disposed is disposed,
 *    and the main dispatcher keeps answering ([MainLoopWatchdog]).
 *
 * Every case runs twice: with the [SyntheticPointerDriver] (everywhere, native
 * Wayland included) and with the [RobotPointerDriver] (a real X server or a
 * real desktop), which is the only one that reaches the platform half.
